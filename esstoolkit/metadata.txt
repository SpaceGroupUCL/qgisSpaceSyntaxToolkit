about=The “Space Syntax Toolkit” is a QGIS plug-in offering user friendly space syntax analysis workflows in a GIS environment.
    It provides a front-end for the depthmapX software within QGIS, for seamless spatial network analysis.
    Furthermore, it includes tools for urban data management and analysis, namely land use, entrances, frontages, pedestrian movement, road centre lines, and service areas.
    Originally developed at the Space Syntax Laboratory, The Bartlett, UCL, the plugin includes contributions from Space Syntax Limited.
    Mailing list: spacesyntax-toolkit@jiscmail.ac.uk
    Dependencies: For network analysis requires depthmapXnet 0.35. It can be downloaded from: http://archtech.gr/varoudis/depthmapX/?dir=depthmapXnet
